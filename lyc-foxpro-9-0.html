As a part of the new job that I've just started, I've been given the task to overcome multiple rather small tasks in FoxPro. Since I've barely had any prior programming experience and seeing that FoxPro is extremly outdated which also happens to incorporate a severe lack of information on the matter, I've struggling quite a bit to come up with appropriate solutions.

I mean, I think people would rather pick the guy who had experience with PHP or something.

Talked to an older dev the other day, apparently he got his CS degree back in the 80s and got jobs focusing on 'visual foxpro' whatever that is. Now he can't get jobs because almost no one uses it.
